webapp:

This implementation has been built using the Vue cli version 3 with a fairly standard configuration and vanilla JavaScript (ignoring the lure of TypeScript).


webserver:

This implementation has been built with the IntelliJ IDE on Windows 10 64-bit.

The unit tests are fairly minimal. I'm not sure how to mock tests for something like this that depends on an external service api. There must be assertion primitives that operator on JSON data, or does that need to be written?
